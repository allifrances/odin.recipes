This is my first Odin HTML project.In this project i will practice the following skills:
HTML boilerplate,
relative links,
relative links (images,
lists.
I found that in this project, the most difficulty i encountered was in attempting to add relative image links. After a lot of googling and reviewing of past Odin lessons I was able to find the solution and clarify my understanding of parent elements/folders/files.
