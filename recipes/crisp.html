    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>6 Golden delicious apples, peeled and chopped (other varieties can be used, can also be sliced).</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon, divided.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp lemon juice.</li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar.</li>
        <li>3/4 cup old fashioned oats.</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, diced into small cubes.</li>
        <li>pinch of kosher salt.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter an 8x8 baking dish, or spray with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, add chopped apples, granulated sugar, 3/4 tsp of the cinnamon and lemon juice. Stir to combine, then transfer to prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a seperate mixing bowl, add topping ingredients (brown sugar, oats, flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, salt, and diced cold butter). Use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the oat mixture, using a slightly downward twisting motion, until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbs. Alternatively, you can use two forks or even your hands to cut butter into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Spread topping over apples in baking dish, and gently pat to even it out. Bake 40-50 minutes, until golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
