    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The following recipe will teach you how to make a delicious plate of crock-pot-bbq ribs.</p>
    <p>Follow along and enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Ribs: You can use St. Louis style spare ribs OR baby back ribs (Either type works fine and tastes great!).</li>
        <li>Barbeque Sauce: Use your favorite BBQ sauce for this recipe. Any kind works, store-bought or homemade.</li>
        <li>Dry Rub: We use a mixture of paprika, brown sugar, red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to make the dry rub seasoning for these ribs.</li>
        <li>Cider Vinegar: This is optional, but I recommend adding it in if you're using a sweeter BBQ sauce. It adds a tanginess and just helps balance out the flavor.</li>
